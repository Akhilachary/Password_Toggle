# Password_Toggle
This is a simple web project that allows users to show or hide their password while typing. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a password input field with an eye icon. Clicking the icon toggles the password between hidden (•••••) and visible (text), enhancing user convenience and improving usability.
